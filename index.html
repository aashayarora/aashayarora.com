					<h2 class="major">intro</h2>
					<p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Experimental Particle Physics at UC San Diego and CERN (CMS), advised by Dr. Frank Würthwein. I build high-throughput data analysis software and applied machine learning systems for the LHC, with a current focus on Higgs boson production via Vector Boson Scattering (VBS). Beyond analysis, my work spans scientific cyberinfrastructure, software-defined networking for data-intensive workflows, and fast inference on heterogeneous hardware.</p>
					<p>Research interests: Higgs/SM measurements with VBS topologies; scalable analysis frameworks; ML for jet tagging and tracking; near-storage data reduction; distributed systems for scientific data; and reproducible workflows.</p>
					<h3>Technical focus</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Analysis frameworks and fast inference: vectorized pipelines with ONNX integration; gradient-boosting and neural network models for jet classification.</li>
						<li>Data management and networking: Rucio, XRootD/HTTPS-TPC, software-defined networking (SENSE), end-to-end storage/transfer benchmarking.</li>
						<li>Platforms and orchestration: Kubernetes (including Multus, Rook), Helm, Docker/containers; site testbeds and multi-site deployments.</li>
						<li>Heterogeneous compute: high-performance NN inference on FPGAs using HLS; resource-aware workflows for large-latency links.</li>

					<h3>Search for Higgs Boson Production through Vector Boson Scattering</h3>
					<p>A CMS analysis targeting Higgs boson production via vector boson scattering (VBS), characterized by two forward jets with a large rapidity gap and central Higgs decay products. The project develops selection strategies and machine‑learning classifiers to separate signal from electroweak and QCD backgrounds, uses CMS Run 2/3 datasets and simulations, and aims to measure or constrain the Higgs quartic gauge coupling and test electroweak symmetry breaking.</p>

					<h3>Software-Defined Networking in Scientific Data Workflows (Exascale era)</h3>
					<p>A multi‑site prototype that couples software‑defined networking (e.g., SENSE) with the HEP data management layer (Rucio) to enable dynamic path provisioning, SDN‑aware data placement, and predictable high‑throughput transfers across wide‑area networks. The testbed validates end‑to‑end performance (storage, protocols, and software stack) on Kubernetes and provides a blueprint for exascale data workflows.</p>

					<h3>Graph Neural Networks and Transformers for Particle Tracking</h3>
					<p>R&D on graph neural networks and Transformer architectures for one‑shot particle track reconstruction in high‑pileup, Phase‑2 conditions. The goal is to improve efficiency and fake‑rate performance over traditional combinatorial tracking while remaining robust and fast enough for large‑scale reconstruction on CMS datasets.</p>

					<h3>Scientific Cyberinfrastructure R&D</h3>
					<p>Infrastructure and tooling to make LHC‑scale analysis reproducible and scalable, including containerized workload management (GlideinWMS), analysis facilities, near‑storage data reduction, and accelerated inference on heterogeneous hardware (e.g., FPGAs). This work underpins reliable operations for distributed analysis and data reduction.</p>

				<article id="outreach">
					<h2 class="major">Outreach & Mentorship</h2>
					<p>Across UC San Diego Physics, my outreach and mentorship focus on broadening participation and supporting students. As Graduate Student Outreach Coordinator (2022–2023), I organized department‑wide volunteering, recruited and scheduled physics volunteers, managed logistics, and taught K–12 students from underrepresented communities. I served on the departmental Outreach Committee (2023–2024) to strengthen community engagement, mentored undergraduates through the Physical Sciences Cohort Program (2022–2023), and advised students as a peer mentor (2022–2024) on academic planning, research involvement, and preparation for graduate school.</p>
